# My Data Analytics and Machine Learning projects
This is a repository for some of the Data Analytics projects I've been working in Python and R. The repository is generally grouped with respect to who I've been studying with. The groups are:

* [Personal Projects](https://github.com/20023167uhi/DataAnalytics/#personal-projects)
* [ScotlandIS](https://github.com/20023167uhi/DataAnalytics/#2020---scotlandis) - Certificate for Professional Development in Data Science
* [Kaggle](https://github.com/20023167uhi/DataAnalytics/#2019---kaggle)
* [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning](https://github.com/20023167uhi/DataAnalytics/#2019---python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning)

## Personal Projects

These are some personal projects I created.

### [2 Ravens - News Aaggregator](https://www.2ravens.co.uk/)

This is my personal website that I put together to read data from RSS feeds and compile the feed into a reddit-style list of elements on the web page. There are features to filter the news stories by source and type (Top Stories, Politics, World, Education, Health, Science, Sports...). It also has a light search function I'm working on improving and also tries to put a location on news stories based on location mentions in the title of the story. The titles are also broken into a list of words and counted and the top 5 occurring words are posted to the website.

### [Random Data Generator](https://github.com/20023167uhi/DataAnalytics/blob/main/Python/Personal%20Projects/Random%20Data%20Generator.ipynb)

This is a small project to randomly create some data based on the probability distribution of a series of data. The function is tested on weather data but it is limited in that the data generated doesn't neccessarily have a correlation to each other unlike how it might do in a real worldly condition. 

## 2020 - ScotlandIS

#### Data science Certificate for Professional Development

This is a short course I took from November 2020 - January 2021 during the Coronavirus with [ScotlandIS](https://www.scotlandis.com/apply-data/) and the University of Highlands and Islands. Working towards a Certificate for Professional Development seemed the best way to spend my time! The course was primarily focused on using *R* instead of *Python* however with my past experience with Python the assignment for *Data Analytics on the Web* I was allowed to write it in Python.
