This is the assignment the data for assignment 1 in the UHI Data Science Short Course for Data Analytics on the Web.

For this a hypothesis is made that *"Weather can have adverse affects on driving conditions."* 

This assignment will attempt to prove this by making a query to Google's Big Query and requesting the data for New York City Collisions and data from the Weather Station in Central Park, New York City.

The `.csv` in this folder is the compiled data from 2012 to (current day, November 27th) 2020.

The `.ipynb` file contains the code used to compile the data, clean it, and save to the `.csv` file stored in this folder.

The data will then be processed through Linear Regression and Neural Network analysis.
