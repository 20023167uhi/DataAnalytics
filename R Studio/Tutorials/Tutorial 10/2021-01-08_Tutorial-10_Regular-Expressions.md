## 1\. Loading dataset

The small regular expression dataset was loaded, and the dataframe is as
shown below.

    # A tibble: 4 x 4
      col1  col2  col3    col4
      <chr> <chr> <chr>  <dbl>
    1 qd    I     a        138
    2 e     NBJ   bb    819974
    3 bus   HZZ   a      68489
    4 nzg   Y     a a    14326

Using `str_detect` the `" "` value, entries in column 3 which have a
space can be detected.

    [1] "a a"

### 1.1 Finding entries with at least 2 letters

The `map_df` function was used with `str_count` expressing the values to
be counted that exist from capital A to lower case z, or `[A-z]`. After
that the values were filtered to replace those less than 2 with `NA`.

``` 
     col1  col2  col3  col4
[1,] "qd"  NA    NA    NA  
[2,] NA    "NBJ" "bb"  NA  
[3,] "bus" "HZZ" NA    NA  
[4,] "nzg" NA    "a a" NA  
```

### 1.2 Finding entries that start with more than 2 letters

The `map_df` was again used to make a `str_count` but the filter
conditions were set to `^[A-z]{2}`. The `^` ensures that the first
letters of the element conform to the following requirement of being
between the symbols of `[A-z]`. Lastly the `{2}` tells the function that
it is looking for 2 elements within the specification of `[A-z]`.

``` 
     col1  col2  col3 col4
[1,] "qd"  NA    NA   NA  
[2,] NA    "NBJ" "bb" NA  
[3,] "bus" "HZZ" NA   NA  
[4,] "nzg" NA    NA   NA  
```

### 1.3 Finding elements with 3 numerics.

This is similar to 1.1 above where the characters were counted but this
time the specification is `[0-9]`, or from 0 to 9.

``` 
     col1 col2 col3 col4    
[1,] NA   NA   NA   NA      
[2,] NA   NA   NA   "819974"
[3,] NA   NA   NA   "68489" 
[4,] NA   NA   NA   "14326" 
```

## 2\. Reading in the weather datasets for `regex` to clean.

The function written to clean the weather station datasets was modified
to include the regular ex(pression functions for cleaning.
`str_remove()` was used to remove the special characters `*` and `#`.
`str_detect()` was used to find where the condition of where the
appearance of `[0-9]` was `FALSE` and set it to `NA`. Lastly the dataset
was set to `as.numeric()` before the set was returned.

    # A tibble: 6 x 6
      station `tmax (degC)` `tmin (degC)` `af (days)` `rain (mm)` `sun (hours)`
      <chr>           <dbl>         <dbl>       <dbl>       <dbl>         <dbl>
    1 Braemar           1.7          -5.7          27          NA          34.2
    2 Braemar           6.2          -3.2          15          NA          68.6
    3 Braemar           7.6           0.8           7          NA          80.9
    4 Braemar          NA            NA            NA          NA         105  
    5 Braemar          15.6           4.6           1          NA         183. 
    6 Braemar          16.4           7.2           0          NA         165.
