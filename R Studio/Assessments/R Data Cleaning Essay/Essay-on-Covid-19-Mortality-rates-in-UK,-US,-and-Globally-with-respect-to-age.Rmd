### Main findings

* Over 2020 `r glob_death_over_case`% of all COVID-19 cases in the world have resulted in death.
* The average age group for deaths by COVID-19 in the US is `r us_mean_death_grp`, and `r us_death_over_cases`% of cases result in death. 
* The average age group for deaths by COVID-19 in the UK is `r uk_mean_death_grp` years, and `r uk_death_over_cases`% of cases result in death.
* The average age group for deaths by COVID-19 in the Scotland is `r scot_mean_death_grp`.

## Introduction

This is a report looking to investigate the ages of death in the coronavirus pandemic of 2020. This report will also look at total deaths and compare that to deaths by similar diseases in previous years to offer a comparison between the COVID-19 deaths and deaths by other diseases.

The inspiration for this study comes from a study performed by Dr Jason Oke where he found that the average age of deceased COVID-19 patients was about 79.5 years where the median was 80.5 and the range from 31 to 103. [@oke2020global] Starting from that study, this essay will investigate where the average age lies with other age groups in the US, UK, and also in Scotland.

But before looking into ages of death, this study will look at the global cases and deaths and a value of deaths/cases or the percentage of cases that resulted in death. 

### Global analysis of COVID-19

A dataset for COVID-19 was obtained online from Our World in Data. [@GlobCovid19] The number of cases and number of deaths has been plotted below to give a perspective of how the number of cases has compared to the number of deaths.

For this plot a select few countries were chosen because too many sources makes the plot too noisy. The selected countries are: United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Russia, China, India, Brazil. The US, Brazil, and India were chose as they seem to have rampant numbers of cases however in the death/case rate is lower than the UK. 

```{r world_case_vs_death_data, echo=FALSE}

# Stating which countries the initial line plots will look at.
loc_to_plot <- c("United Kingdom",
                 "Germany",
                 "Russia",
                 "Spain",
                 "India",
                 "Brazil",
                 "United States",
                 "China",
                 "Italy"
                 )

# Filter for only the select countries
global_covid_fil <- filter(global_covid, location %in% loc_to_plot)

# Plot the Cases and the Deaths with respect to date.
p1 <- plot_ly(
    # Data set
    global_covid_fil,
    # State the x value from dataset, will plot out as time series
    x = ~date,
    # state the y value from dataset 
    y = ~total_cases,

  )

p2 <- plot_ly(
    global_covid_fil,
    x = ~date,
    y = ~total_deaths,

    legend = list(title = list(text='Country')),
    # set width of plots
    width = 900
  )
# Plot and show X and Y axis titles. Plot in 1 column.
psub <- subplot(p1, p2, titleY = TRUE, titleX=TRUE, nrows = 2) 
orca(psub, "figs/world_case_vs_death_data.svg")
# It was proposed to export the images from plotly so they could be used as 
# figures for the markdown however automating this would require another package
# https://plotly-r.com/exporting-static-images.html

}
```
     
The number of cases for each country has been divided by the number of deaths to give a death/case percentage or a measure of how many cases resulted in deaths. Ideally for a country successfully treating the virus the ratio will be low, close to zero.

```{r world_case_ov_death_plt}
# Plot the deaths over cases
p <- plot_ly(
  global_covid_fil,
  x = ~date,
  y = ~total_deaths_over_cases,
  color = ~location,
  colors = "Spectral",
  type = "scatter",
  mode = "lines"
) %>%
layout(
  title = "Plot of culmulative deaths by COVID-19 over 2020 by country",
  xaxis = list(title = "Date"),
  yaxis = list(title = "Total Deaths/Total Cases", tickformat = ',.0%'),
  legend = list(title = list(text='Country'), y = 0.75),
  width = 900
)
orca(p, "figs/world_case_ov_death_plt.svg")

if (is_html){
  p
} else {
  knitr::include_graphics("figs/world_case_ov_death_plt.svg")
}

```
What these plots show is the United States has the greatest increase in coronavirus cases, followed by Brazil which is overtaken by India in September. The number of deaths is difficult to read with respect to number of cases so a ratio of cases over deaths is calculated.

What the deaths over cases curves show is that of the selected locations the number of deaths vs cases peaks and then tails off at the end of October. What's interesting to see is that although the US has a very high number of cases and number of death, their ratio is not as great as Spain or the United Kingdom. Russia appears to have the lowest ratio followed by India and Germany. China has an unusual step in their values in the middle of April and then stays constant, and looking at the raw data it would be because China doesn't report many new deaths after the 15th of April. 

Looking at the total number of cases across the globe for 2020 a choropleth can be plotted to show where the hot spots of COVID-19 have occurred. Some of the countries appear to report a very low value for COVID-19 and this may be due to lack of testing facilities. 

```{r glob_cases, echo=FALSE}
global_covid_chor <- drop_na(global_covid, total_cases)

# $location has a value of "World" which is the sum of the other locations. It 
# skews the colorbar into larger values that dwarfs the actual location values.
global_covid_chor <- filter(global_covid_chor, date == "2020-12-31" & location != "World")


p <- plot_ly(
  # Plot data
  global_covid_chor,
  # Stating graph type: choropleth
  type='choropleth',
  # Using ISO codes for location data
  locations= ~iso_code,
  # Setting colour scheme to shade based on total cases
  z=~total_cases,
  # Setting colour bar
  colorbar = list(title = "Total Cases", yanchor = "middle"),
  # Setting colour scheme
  colorscale = "Rainbow"
) %>%
layout(
  title = "Total number of cases of COVID-19 globally for 2020",
  width = 900
)

orca(p, "figs/world_choro_cases_plt.svg")

if (is_html){
  p
} else {
  knitr::include_graphics("figs/world_choro_cases_plt.svg")
}


p <- plot_ly(
  global_covid_chor,
  type='choropleth',
  locations= ~iso_code,
  z=~total_deaths,
  colorbar = list(title = "Total Deaths", yanchor = "middle"),
  colorscale = "Rainbow"
) %>%
layout(
  title = "Total number of deaths by COVID-19 globally for 2020",
  width = 900
)

orca(p, "figs/world_choro_death_plt.svg")

if (is_html){
  p
} else {
  knitr::include_graphics("figs/world_choro_death_plt.svg")
}

max_death_loc <- global_covid_chor[which.max(global_covid_chor$total_deaths_over_cases),]
```

And interestingly the country that has suffered COVID-19 the longest seems to be one of the countries with the least number of cases and least number of deaths.

```{r glob_deaths_over_cases, echo=FALSE}
p <- plot_ly(
  global_covid_chor,
  type='choropleth',
  locations= ~iso_code,
  z=~total_deaths_over_cases,
  colorbar = list(title = "Total Deaths/Cases", yanchor = "middle", tickformat = ',.0%'),
  colorscale = "Rainbow"
) %>%
layout(
  title = "Total deaths / cases of COVID-19 globally for 2020",
  legend = list(title = list(text='Country')),
  width = 900
)

orca(p, "figs/glob_deaths_over_cases.svg")

if (is_html){
  p
} else {
  knitr::include_graphics("figs/glob_deaths_over_cases.svg")
}
```
Plotting deaths divided by cases shows the probability of what percentage are expected to die with respect to cases, and interestingly `r max_death_loc$location` seems to suffer the greatest number of deaths to case ratio at `r max_death_loc$total_deaths_over_cases * 100`%. And looking into the data of `r max_death_loc$location`, the number of deaths they see is `r max_death_loc$total_deaths` with respect to `r max_death_loc$total_cases` cases.

### US analysis of deaths vs age

The CDC published figures per state looking at age groups and deaths due to COVID-19.
[@UsCovid19] The data consists of two method of age group - "under 1 year, 1-4 years, 5-14 years,..." and "0-17 years, 18-29 years, ..." and the second set was filtered out. Additionally the data also held information on the sexes and individual states however this essay looks at both sexes and the deaths across the united states. The data also includes `Pneumonia Deaths`, `Pneumonia and COVID-19 deaths`, `Influenza Deaths`, and `Pneumonia, Influenza or COVID-19 Deaths`.

```{r us_age_death}

p <- plot_ly(
  us_df_fil,
  x = ~`Age group`,
  y = ~`COVID-19 Deaths`,
  color = ~`Age group`,
  colors = "Spectral",
  type = "bar",
  mode = "unstack"
) %>%
layout(
  title = "US COVID-19 deaths by age group for 2020",
  xaxis = list(
            title = "Age Group", 
            categoryorder = "array", 
            categoryarray = us_df_fil$`Age group`
          ),
  yaxis = list(title = "Deaths"),
  legend = list(title = list(text='Age group'), y = 0.75),
  width = 900
)

orca(p, "figs/us_age_death.svg")

if (is_html){
  p
} else {
  knitr::include_graphics("figs/us_age_death.svg")
}
```

The age groups are a string integer which is difficult to find the average value by. The average occurring index value will be looked at instead and then rounded to an integer. The average occurring index value will then be considered as the average occurring age group for mortality by COVID-19. By setting the index to a column and multiplying each index by the count of `COVID-19 Deaths` and dividing by the total sum of the `COVID-19 Deaths`, the average row number value occurring can be found, and this row value can be referenced into the data to pull out the average age group for for deaths. 

What is found is that the age group of `r us_mean_death_grp` is where the average number of deaths lay.

From the US dataset, the COVID-19 data compared to other causes of death, particularly pneumonia.

### UK analysis of deaths vs age

Now looking at the United Kingdom, the UK government has published data of coronavirus *related* deaths with respect to age. [@UkCovid19] In the datasets the deaths recorded are as *involving COVID-19*, so they may not specifically be due to the coronavirus, but it may have been a contributing factor. This has the issue of obfuscating the clarity of the reason of death. 

The data from the national office of statistics was presented in an excel spreadsheet which makes the data very tidy but hard to navigate when importing without a bit of cleaning taking place. 

For instance two slices of cells are sampled from a sheet. The first slice holds the row names of age group and the associated data in that row of deaths with respect to the date in the year. The second slice is of the dates themselves as column names. The table is imported as a matrix, transposed to have the 'row names' as column names, and converted into a tibble. The 'row names' are not an index value so that row of elements can be used to name the `colnames()` and then that row is removed from the dataframe. The dates were also imported as a dataframe but the dates themselves are imported as an excel `date-number`. `read_excel()` recognizes and automatically converts these numbers to a `date` type.

```{r uk_age_death_by_date}
# Setting up tibble for plotting
uk_df_plot <- tibble()

uk_df_plot <- pivot_longer(
                uk_df,
                cols = colnames(uk_data),
                names_to = "Age group",
                values_to = "death_vals"
              )

uk_df_plot$`Age group` <- factor(
                uk_df_plot$`Age group`,
                levels = colnames(uk_data)
              )


p <- plot_ly(
  uk_df_plot,
  x = ~Date,
  y = ~death_vals,
  color = ~`Age group`,
  colors = "Spectral",
  type = "scatter",
  mode = "line"
) %>%
layout(
  title = "UK COVID-19 deaths by age group for 2020",
  xaxis = list(title = "Date"),
  yaxis = list(title = "Deaths"),
  legend = list(title = list(text='Age group')),
  width = 900
)

orca(p, "figs/uk_age_death_by_date.svg")

if (is_html){
  p
} else {
  knitr::include_graphics("figs/uk_age_death_by_date.svg")
}
```

The date was then added to the dataset to give the values of number of deaths by date, and summed to give total deaths for each age group.

```{r uk_age_death}
p <- plot_ly(
  uk_df_plot_2,
  x = ~`Age group`,
  y = ~`COVID-19 Deaths`,
  color = ~`Age group`,
  colors = "Spectral",
  type = "bar",
  mode = "unstack"
) %>%
layout(
  title = "UK COVID-19 deaths by age group for 2020",
  xaxis = list(
            title = "Age Group (years)",
            categoryorder = "array",
            categoryarray = uk_df_plot_2$`Age group`,
            tickangle = 45
          ),
  yaxis = list(title = "Deaths"),
  legend = list(title = list(text='Age group')),
  width = 900
) 

orca(p, "figs/uk_age_death.svg")

if (is_html){
  p
} else {
  knitr::include_graphics("figs/uk_age_death.svg")
}
```

What is found is that the age group of `r uk_mean_death_grp` is where the average number of deaths lay.

### Scotland analysis of deaths vs age

The Scottish COVID-19 data can be obtained from the National Records of Scotland. [@ScotCovid19] This dataset has been quite difficult to work with. The `.csv` files had to be downloaded individually for each age group. A list of filenames looking for a pattern has to be generated and then the list is mapped to a `read_csv()` function not just once but twice. The data inside the `.csv` has a bit of information about the data inside the `.csv` but after this is a blank row which the `read_csv()` function considers as the end of file. The second `read_csv()` function run is set to skip down to where the data begins again so that those rows may be read in. The first `read_csv()` pulls  the data detail of age group which will be used for the column header to the main data.

The main data was read in by skipping a few rows. Then the first two columns had to be dropped and the colnames were set to the date which was on the first row of data. Two values of the annual totals are included at the end of the dataset which were not required so they were dropped as columns after the `colnames()` were set. `pivot_longer()` was used to orientate the data from being in a wide date to having a column of dates and an associated column of deaths, setting the deaths column name to the age group from the first `read_csv()`. The date column had an additional string of `"w/c "` so the `str_remove()` was used to remove the pattern from the date column. It was then convert the date into a `Date` type. This small dataframe was then returned to the list that was being mapped in. After the mapping, the `reduce()` function was run to join the lists by an `inner_join()` using the `Date` column.

And now the dataset is as a dataframe and can be plotted.

```{r scot_death_over_year}
scot_df_plot <- pivot_longer(
                scot_data,
                cols = age_groups,
                names_to = "Age group",
                values_to = "death_vals"
              )

scot_df_plot$`Age group` <- factor(
                scot_df_plot$`Age group`,
                levels = age_groups
              )


p <- plot_ly(
  scot_df_plot,
  x = ~Date,
  y = ~death_vals,
  color = ~`Age group`,
  colors = "Spectral",
  type = "scatter",
  mode = "line"
) %>%
layout(
  title = "Scotland COVID-19 deaths by age group over 2020",
  xaxis = list(title = "Date"),
  yaxis = list(title = "Deaths"),
  colorbar = list(title = "COVID-19 Deaths", yanchor = "middle"),
  legend = list(title = list(text='Age group'), y = 0.75),
  width = 900
)

orca(p, "figs/scot_death_over_year.svg")

if (is_html){
  p
} else {
  knitr::include_graphics("figs/scot_death_over_year.svg")
}
```

And the total deaths for each age group for COVID-19 in 2020 is plotted below.
```{r scot_age_death}
p <- plot_ly(
  scot_df_plot_2,
  x = ~`Age group`,
  y = ~`COVID-19 Deaths`,
  color = ~`Age group`,
  colors = "Spectral",
  type = "bar",
  mode = "unstack"
) %>%
layout(
  title = "Scotland COVID-19 deaths by age group for 2020",
  xaxis = list(title = "Age Group"),
  yaxis = list(title = "Deaths"),
  legend = list(title = list(text='Age group'), y = 0.75),
  width = 900
)

orca(p, "figs/scot_age_death.svg")

if (is_html){
  p
} else {
  knitr::include_graphics("figs/scot_age_death.svg")
}
```

And again the mean occurrence of where the deaths occur in COVID-19 by age group is `r scot_mean_death_grp`.

## Conclusions

This has been a bit of a gradient in working with datasets. The Global data set was easy to work with and well laid out, the `.csv` was a bit large with extra details, and it didn't have age specific details in it but some plots could be made with it. The US dataset was the samilarly easy to work with, there were age groups included with the data which were superfluous to this essay's needs. The UK Office of National Statistics excel spreadsheet was initially difficult to read in as a sheet had to be stated and a portion of cells extracted. The data had to be manipulated and molded into a `tibble()` with a date column. The sheets may be trimmed down in order to package the project for submission. The scottish data was the most difficult as it was held in different `.csv`s and a row of white space prevented the files from being read in properly. Thankfully the data was presented in the file in a uniform manner so a function could be written to open and read the data by skipping over the blank row.
